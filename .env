# Vite dev server proxy target for the backend API
# Change this to your backend URL. For local development, ensure your backend runs on 8000
# (or update the port/host below accordingly), then restart `npm run dev`.
# Note: In Codespaces, many backends are HTTPS-only. If HTTP (port 80) is refused,
# switch to HTTPS (port 443) as below.
