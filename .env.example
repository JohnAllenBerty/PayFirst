# Vite dev server proxy target for the backend API
# Example: Codespaces public URL (include trailing slash)
# VITE_API_TARGET=https://<your-codespaces-app>-8000.app.github.dev/

# Default local Django server
VITE_API_TARGET=http://localhost:8000/

# Optional: preserve "/api" prefix when proxying
# If set to true, the dev server will forward "/api/*" as-is to the target (no rewrite).
# Useful when your backend exposes endpoints under "/api/*" and your target does NOT already include "/api" in its path.
# VITE_API_PRESERVE_PREFIX=false

# Optional: HTTPS proxy for production (GitHub Pages) to avoid mixed content
# Set this to your deployed Cloudflare Worker or other HTTPS proxy that forwards to your HTTP backend.
# Example:
# VITE_API_HTTPS_PROXY=https://payfirst-proxy.<your-account>.workers.dev
